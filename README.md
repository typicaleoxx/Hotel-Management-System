# HotelManagementSystem

## Description
Hotel Management System is a a Django backend application, built using Django and Django REST Framework, designed to facilitate various hotel management tasks, including accounting, front desk operations, restaurant management, and overall hotel administration. The project is structured into distinct Django apps, each catering to specific functionalities within the hotel management system. These apps include:
